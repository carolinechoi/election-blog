      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main question I will be answering in this blog post is the question of how we should treat the incumbency advantage in our 2024 election forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The incumbency advantage has been long documented in our history. For example, 8 out of 12 incumbent presidents have won re-election. As for the House of Representatives, about 90% of incumbents are re-elected on a bad year. If those were the odds for betting in Vegas, I would be booking my ticket there right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
